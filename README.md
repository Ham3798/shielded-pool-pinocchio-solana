## Technical Detail

**Core idea:** ZK for privacy + RLWE (FHE) for compliance. Two circuits share `wa_commitment` as the bridge: (1) Shielded Pool proves valid withdrawal; (2) RLWE Audit proves identity is correctly encrypted. No single party can decrypt; only 2-of-3 designated auditors can jointly recover identity via Shamir.

**Key mechanism:**
- `wa_commitment = Poseidon(owner_x, owner_y)` — shared public input linking both circuits
- Identity encrypted with RLWE; ZK proves encryption correctness on-chain
- Constant PK optimization: 42x fewer constraints (1.1M → 26K) via negacyclic row hardcoding

**Stack:** Noir · Sunspot · Pinocchio · BabyJubJub · RLWE + Shamir 2-of-3 · Poseidon

**Flow:** Initialize (relayer) → Deposit (Merkle root update) → Withdraw (ZK + Audit proof verified on-chain)

**Next:** WASM proof gen, multi-asset (SPL), relayer network
